O(n log n) means =======>

    O(n log n) is a way to describe how fast an algorithm grows as the input size n increases.
    This is called Big-O notation.

    What does O(n log n) mean?

    n → number of elements (input size)

    log n → logarithmic growth (usually base 2, but base doesn’t matter in Big-O)

    👉 O(n log n) means:

    When the input size doubles, the work increases a little more than double, but much less than n².

    Simple intuition 🧠

    Imagine:

    n = 8
    log₂ 8 = 3
    Operations ≈ 8 × 3 = 24

    n = 16
    log₂ 16 = 4
    Operations ≈ 16 × 4 = 64

    So when input doubles (8 → 16), work increases ~2.6×, not 4×.


O(log n) means ========>

    O(log n) means the algorithm’s running time grows very slowly as the input size n increases.
    It’s one of the fastest time complexities.

    What does O(log n) actually mean?

    n = number of input elements

    log n = logarithm (usually base 2 in CS, but base doesn’t matter in Big-O)

    👉 O(log n) means:

    Each step reduces the problem size significantly (often by half).

    Simple intuition 🧠

    If n doubles, the work increases by just 1 extra step.

    Example:

    n	log₂ n
    8	3
    16	4
    32	5
    1,000,000	~20

    Even with 1 million elements, only ~20 steps are needed 😮

    Why does O(log n) happen?

        Because the algorithm:

        Divides the input size every step

        Doesn’t scan all elements
