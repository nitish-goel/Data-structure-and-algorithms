What Space Complexity Actually Means

Space Complexity = Extra memory used by the algorithm

👉 It counts only the auxiliary space, not the result/output.

Auxiliary space includes:

Variables (i, j)

Arrays / objects created inside the algorithm

Recursion stack

Why Printing Is NOT Counted in Space Complexity

When you do:

System.out.print("*");

What happens internally:

The character is immediately sent to the output stream

It is not stored in your program’s memory

Once printed → memory is released

So:

*****


is not stored anywhere in RAM by your algorithm.

Think of It Like This 🧠

Imagine writing stars on a whiteboard:

You write *

It stays on the board

You didn’t store it in your pocket

💡 Space complexity only counts what’s in your pocket (memory)
Not what’s written outside (output).

Example Comparison
❌ This DOES affect space complexity
char[] arr = new char[num * num];


➡ Uses extra memory → O(n²) space

✅ This does NOT affect space complexity
for (...) {
    System.out.print("*");
}


➡ Prints directly → O(1) space

Output Size vs Space Complexity
Concept	         Counted?     	Why
Output size	     ❌ No	      Not stored in memory
Print statements ❌ No	      Direct stream output
Variables	     ✅ Yes	      Stored in RAM
Arrays / Lists	 ✅ Yes	      Stored in RAM
Recursion stack	 ✅ Yes	      Stored in RAM

Common Interview Line (Use This ✅)
“Space complexity measures auxiliary memory used by the algorithm, not the memory required to store the output.”

Final Takeaway ⭐
    Printing affects time complexity
    Printing does NOT affect space complexity
