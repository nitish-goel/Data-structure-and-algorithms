            Used for	                  Strings, permutations	     Numbers
            Example                       [1, 3, 2] < [2, 1, 1]	     132 < 211

⭐  Sum of n numbers is n(n+1)/2
⭐  Sum of n^2 numbers is n(n+1)(2n+1)/6

⭐  Find pairs of digits: factorial of number of digits     
                        for exp:
                                there are 3 digits 2,4,6 
                                factorial of 3 = 6 pairs
                                therefore 6 pairs are there: 2,4,6
                                                             2,6,4
                                                             4,2,6
                                                             4,6,2
                                                             6,2,4
                                                             6,4,2
